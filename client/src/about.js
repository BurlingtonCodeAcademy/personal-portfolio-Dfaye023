      <p>I was born and raised in Rutland, Vermont. I've had several different jobs in the area, but am currently looking to start a career in software development.< br/>
      I chose this career path due to its high demand and ease of access. BCA has given me the tools to learn and develop the required skills to embark on a career in software development.< br/>
      It is my hope to tie my experience with video games togethe with my newfound software development skills to gain employment in the video game industry.< br/> </p>
